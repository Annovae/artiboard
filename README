This project is very new. 
Currently compiles on MINGW and runs checkers game experiments.
The plan is to develop a very simple interactive web interface.

Dependancies
------------
1. Uses TUT for a testing framework  (http://tut-framework.sourceforge.net/)
2. USes Mongoose as embedded web server (http://code.google.com/p/mongoose/)
